# Notebook

This is Notebook created just for fun.
I am fully aware of not encrypted passwords, and not closing the connections.
This is created this way for testing.


There are two ways to use this Notepad:

1. Serialization of user data.
2. MySQL database connection.

MySQL db is created localy so for external user, to run it sucessfully, 
it needs to be run with "FILE" argument on Main class (as it is initially).
