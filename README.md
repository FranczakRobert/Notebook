# Notebook

This is Notebook created just for fun.
I am fully aware of not encrypted passwords, and not closing connections.
This is created this way for testing.


There are two ways to use this Notepad:

1. Serialization of user data - with **FILE** argument.
2. MySQL database connection  - with **MYSQL** argument.

MySQL db is created localy so for external user, to run it sucessfully, 
it needs to be run with "FILE" argument on Main class (as it is initially).
